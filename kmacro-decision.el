;; This library changes keyboard macro query points into decision points or conditional
;; branches. A query point can be created by typing C-x q or entering the `kbd-macro-query'
;; command when entering a keyboard macro.
;; When the macro is replayed and the query point is reached the user will be prompted with
;; options to either quit the macro, continue the rest of the macro, enter recursive edit and
;; store a new macro, add a conditional branch (explained next), or replay a previously saved
;; (named) macro.
;; If the user chooses to add a conditional branch they will be prompted for a condition form,
;; and an action to perform if that condition evaluates to non-nil. The action can be to quit the macro,
;; continue the macro, create a new macro for that condition, or replay a previously saved macro.
;; If the condition evaluates to non-nil the next time the macro is replayed then the corresponding
;; action will be performed. If several conditions-action pairs are created for a given query point
;; then the conditions will be evaluated in the order in which they where created until one of them evaluates
;; to non-nil. If they all evaluate to nil then the user will be prompted as before to either quit, continue,
;; create/replay a macro, or add another condition-action pair.

;; By adding query points to the end of each newly created macro, macro decision trees can be built up
;; and complex automated operations performed.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put kmacro-decision.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'kmacro-decision)

  "Prompt for an action to perform, or conditional branch to add to a query point in a keyboard macro.
This is a replacement for the `kbd-macro-query' command that comes with emacs.
When called from within a keyboard macro it offer the user the following choices:

1) Quit the macro
2) Continue executing the macro
3) Enter recursive edit and create a new named macro
4) Add a conditional branch
5) Replay a previously saved named macro

If the user chooses to add a conditional branch they will be further prompted for a condition form
and an action to perform if that form evaluates to non-nil the next time that the query point
is reached."
